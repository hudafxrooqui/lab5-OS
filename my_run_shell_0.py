"""my_run_shell_0.py:
Simple shell to start programs, e.g., try "PShell>ps" and "PShell>ls".

The purpose of this script is to give you simple functions
for locating an executable program in common locations in Linux/UNIX
(PATH environmental variable).

You are meant to paste your code from your solution in Part A
into the relevant points in this script.

Try to stick to Style Guide for Python Code and Docstring Conventions:
see https://peps.python.org/pep-0008 and https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/

(Note: The breakdown into Input/Action/Output in this script is just a suggestion.)
